Because Afghanistan is the place that has confronted our politicians with the terrible truth - that they cannot understand what is going on any longer. The film reveals the forces that over the past thirty years rose up and undermined the confidence of politics to understand the world.

He has tried to build a different and more emotional way of depicting what really happened in Afghanistan. A counterpoint to the thin, narrow and increasingly destructive stories told by those in power today."

Harold, the son of a Lithuanian Jew, lives a somewhat-privileged life as a student at Cambridge and uses being the fastest to overcome what he sees as the obstacles he faces in life a Jew despite that privilege. In his words to paraphrase an old adage, he is often invited to the trough, but isn't allowed to drink. His running prowess does earn him the respect of his classmates, especially his running teammates, and to some extent the school administration, if only he maintains what they consider proper gentlemanly decorum, which isn't always the case in their minds. Eric Liddell, a Scot born to Christian missionaries in China, is a devout member of the Church of Scotland who hopes to eventually return to that missionary work. He sees running as a win-win: the notoriety of being fast gives him an added outlet to spread the word of God, while he sees his speed as being a gift from God, and he wants to run to honor God and that gift. This view does not sit well with his sister Jennie, who sees his running as only taking away time from his work to God. Harold and Eric's lives intersect in national races, but it is the 100-meter track event at the 1924 Paris Olympics which the two men and their supporters most anticipate. Beyond the fact that Americans Charles Paddock and Jackson Scholz are favored in the event, the much-anticipated head-to-head between Harold and Eric could be further shadowed by other issues, especially as it affects Eric's Christian beliefs."

He titled it Return to the Edge of the World. Contrary to the falsehood distributed practically everywhere now regarding the color film from 1978, thanks to an utterly misleading description of the plot summary previously here (which was not a plot summary at all but a lot of misinformation about the color film) here is clarification. To clarify. Firstly, there is The Edge of the World (1937) which runs for 1 hour and 14 minutes and 55 seconds. Then, secondly, there is Return to the Edge of the World (1978) which runs for as i say, 23 minutes and 45 seconds. There simply IS no third version running for 1 hour 38 minutes and 40 seconds as the previous poster seemed to insist upon. There is no post 1978 re release ""version"" of Edge of the World in it's original black and white but now with 1978 color bookends of approximately 11 minutes or 12 minutes each AT each end of the original 1937 movie. The poster who described this non existent ""third version"" possibly just tried to overstretch themselves descriptively but in the process has caused a LOT of confusion as their plot summary has been lifted from the IMDb to describe Return to the Edge of the World (1978) practically everywhere on the internet. Hope this helps."
